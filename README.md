# Object Detection with YOLOv4

This repository contains a Python script for performing object detection on images using the YOLOv4 model. The script detects objects in an input image and draws bounding boxes around the detected objects along with their class names and confidence scores.

## Requirements

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for Google Colab)

To install the required packages, run the following commands:
